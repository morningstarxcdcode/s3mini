## Installation

```bash
npm install s3mini
```

```bash
yarn add s3mini
```

```bash
pnpm add s3mini
```

> **⚠️ Environment Support Notice**
>
> This library is designed to run in environments like **Node.js**, **Bun**, and **Cloudflare Workers**. It does **not support browser environments** due to the use of Node.js APIs and polyfills.
>
> **Cloudflare Workers:** To enable built-in Node.js Crypto API, add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file. This also enables `nodejs_compat_v2` as long as your compatibility date is `2024-09-23` or later. [Learn more about the Node.js compatibility flag and v2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

## Usage

```typescript
import { s3mini, sanitizeETag } from 's3mini';

const s3client = new s3mini({
  accessKeyId: config.accessKeyId,
  secretAccessKey: config.secretAccessKey,
  endpoint: config.endpoint,
  region: config.region,
});

// Basic bucket ops
let exists: boolean = false;
try {
  // Check if the bucket exists
  exists = await s3client.bucketExists();
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error(`Failed bucketExists() call, wrong credentials maybe: ${err.message}`);
}
if (!exists) {
  // Create the bucket based on the endpoint bucket name
  await s3client.createBucket();
}

// Basic object ops
// key is the name of the object in the bucket
const smallObjectKey: string = 'small-object.txt';
// content is the data you want to store in the object
// it can be a string or Buffer (recommended for large objects)
const smallObjectContent: string = 'Hello, world!';

// check if the object exists
const objectExists: boolean = await s3client.objectExists(smallObjectKey);
let etag: string | null = null;
if (!objectExists) {
  // put/upload the object, content can be a string or Buffer
  // to add object into "folder", use "folder/filename.txt" as key
  const resp: Response = await s3client.putObject(smallObjectKey, smallObjectContent);
  // you can also get etag via getEtag method
  // const etag: string = await s3client.getEtag(smallObjectKey);
  etag = sanitizeETag(resp.headers.get('etag'));
}

// get the object, null if not found
const objectData: string | null = await s3client.getObject(smallObjectKey);
console.log('Object data:', objectData);

// get the object with ETag, null if not found
const response2: Response = await s3mini.getObject(smallObjectKey, { 'if-none-match': etag });
if (response2) {
  // ETag changed so we can get the object data and new ETag
  // Note: ETag is not guaranteed to be the same as the MD5 hash of the object
  // ETag is sanitized to remove quotes
  const etag2: string = sanitizeETag(response2.headers.get('etag'));
  console.log('Object data with ETag:', response2.body, 'ETag:', etag2);
} else {
  console.log('Object not found or ETag does match.');
}

// list objects in the bucket, null if bucket is empty
// Note: listObjects uses listObjectsV2 API and iterate over all pages
// so it will return all objects in the bucket which can take a while
// If you want to limit the number of objects returned, use the maxKeys option
// If you want to list objects in a specific "folder", use "folder/" as prefix
// Example s3client.listObjects({"/" "myfolder/"})
const list: object[] | null = await s3client.listObjects();
if (list) {
  console.log('List of objects:', list);
} else {
  console.log('No objects found in the bucket.');
}

// delete the object
const wasDeleted: boolean = await s3client.deleteObject(smallObjectKey);

// Multipart upload
const multipartKey = 'multipart-object.txt';
const large_buffer = new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024 * 15); // 15 MB buffer
const partSize = 8 * 1024 * 1024; // 8 MB
const totalParts = Math.ceil(large_buffer.length / partSize);
// Beware! This will return always a new uploadId
// if you want to use the same uploadId, you need to store it somewhere
const uploadId = await s3client.getMultipartUploadId(multipartKey);
const uploadPromises = [];
for (let i = 0; i < totalParts; i++) {
  const partBuffer = large_buffer.subarray(i * partSize, (i + 1) * partSize);
  // upload each part
  // Note: uploadPart returns a promise, so you can use Promise.all to upload all parts in parallel
  // but be careful with the number of parallel uploads, it can cause throttling
  // or errors if you upload too many parts at once
  // You can also use generator functions to upload parts in batches
  uploadPromises.push(s3client.uploadPart(multipartKey, uploadId, partBuffer, i + 1));
}
const uploadResponses = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
const parts = uploadResponses.map((response, index) => ({
  partNumber: index + 1,
  etag: response.etag,
}));
// Complete the multipart upload
const completeResponse = await s3client.completeMultipartUpload(multipartKey, uploadId, parts);
const completeEtag = completeResponse.etag;

// List multipart uploads
// returns object with uploadId and key
const multipartUploads: object = await s3client.listMultipartUploads();
// Abort the multipart upload
const abortResponse = await s3client.abortMultipartUpload(multipartUploads.key, multipartUploads.uploadId);

// Multipart download
// lets test getObjectRaw with range
const rangeStart = 2048 * 1024; // 2 MB
const rangeEnd = 8 * 1024 * 1024 * 2; // 16 MB
const rangeResponse = await s3client.getObjectRaw(multipartKey, false, rangeStart, rangeEnd);
const rangeData = await rangeResponse.arrayBuffer();
```

## Test Setup & Environment Variables

- To run tests, you must set environment variables for each provider, e.g.:
  - `BUCKET_ENV_MINIO=provider,accessKey,secret,endpoint,region`
  - `BUCKET_ENV_CLOUDFLARE=...` (see `.github/workflows/test-e2e.yml` for examples)
- If these are not set, tests will be skipped. For local development, you can add mock values or use the new mock mode (see below).

## Mock/Fallback Test Mode

- If no environment variables are set, tests will run in mock mode and only basic logic/unit tests will execute.

## Deprecated Dependencies

- Some dependencies (e.g., `inflight`, `glob`) are deprecated. Consider updating them in future releases.

## Unit Tests

- Added a basic unit test example in `tests/utils.unit.test.js`.

## Security Notes

- The library masks sensitive information (access keys, session tokens, etc.) when logging.
- Always protect your AWS credentials and avoid hard-coding them in your application (!!!). Use environment variables. Use environment variables or a secure vault for storing credentials.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and perform operations.
- Be cautious when using multipart uploads, as they can incur additional costs if not managed properly.
- Authors are not responsible for any data loss or security breaches resulting from improper usage of the library.
- If you find a security vulnerability, please report it to us directly via email. For more details, please refer to the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file.
